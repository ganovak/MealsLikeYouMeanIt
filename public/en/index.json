	"content": "Hi, my name is Gabby, and I am measurement-adverse. I can justify this by reminding you that measurement is lie invented by control freaks anyhow since flavor, size, and water density of vegetables changes between times of year, region, and species. Moisture in the air affects baking (I know, its infuriating). So does the room temperature. Even with processed products and pantry staples, there is variation between brands, types, and region in flavor, density, and properties. Water boils at a different temperature depending on where you are for Pete\u0026rsquo;s sake. And to throw a wrench in this already existing cluster, personal taste is a thing. Maybe you like this or that spicier or saltier or boozier or thicker or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re like Joe and think the best gumbo is just a bowl of rice. You have to account for this on your own. So, taste your food, if you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, fix it. Don\u0026rsquo;t get wrapped up in the recipes, they\u0026rsquo;re probably wrong. I just made most of them up anyways. Feel free to bastardize them, I certainly do. Use what\u0026rsquo;s in season, what you\u0026rsquo;ve got laying around whatever. Dress it up, dress it down, strip it bare and hide it in the cellar, whatever your fancy. Logistically, this is how it goes. Name of the recipe is at the top of the page. They are followed by an intro section where I maybe give you some information about the dish or maybe just mumble about something that may or may not be loosely related like a suburban Mom whose shitty husband model #682 can\u0026rsquo;t remember her middle name. It should include serving suggestions and pairings. Then, finally, comes the actual recipe. Ingredients, instructions, you know the drill. If you do not recognize an ingredient, allow me to direct you to the ingredient appendix, prepared specifically for your convenience where all is made clear to you. The appendix is also where you will find substitutions and the like. I think that\u0026rsquo;s all the information you need. If not, figure it out. Or give me a call. Whatever.\n"

	"content": "Multiplication and Division Technically I could make this short and sweet, tell you that half of 1/3 cup is about 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons, and allow us all to move on with our lives. That really is most of what you need to know. However, the rest of what you need to know requires fluency in multiplication and division, both of which continue to elude me despite my ongoing campaign to trick the UR math department into handing me a degree. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to tell you this, but if a recipe calls for a fractional bit of something I don\u0026rsquo;t want to split (like an egg), I usually round up.

	"content": "Once upon a time, I was waiting patiently for Mary to swipe me into Danfo when I was brutally attacked by one who I had thought an ally. Ella asked me how cold it was outside (everyone\u0026rsquo;s go to conversational topic in Rochester, NY from October through May). I responded 30 degrees. She looked me dead in the eye and asked me what that was in \u0026ldquo;real degrees\u0026rdquo;. That is to say that yes, the metric system has slightly more order to its arbitration, but I am an American, therefore it is my patriotic duty to be a stubborn git and make people from other countries look smarter in comparison. Moral of the story, I don\u0026rsquo;t get the metric system. Honestly, you should be grateful I\u0026rsquo;m providing measurements at all.\nVolume Entries in each row are equivilent.

Technically mass is a measure of the matter in an object, measured in kilograms or because America is stubborn, pounds, ounces, etc. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object, measured in Newtons, which is an entirely useless measure for cooking. You may be asking yourself, but all objects on Earth are acted on by the same force of gravity so why does it matter. At which point I would inform you that gravitation has to do with the distance between the center of the object and the center of the gravitating body which is why your weight (but not mass) changes slightly at high altitudes. Additionally, while all objects near the surface of the Earth have the same acceleration due to gravity, the actual force exerted on them by gravity is dependent on their mass. There\u0026rsquo;s also other things that matter like air resistance. So no, objects are not acted on by an equal force of gravity and yes, scales display mass because the math is simple and the mortals don\u0026rsquo;t understand physics. You may now consider yourself educated.)\nThat said, I don\u0026rsquo;t really use massive measurements unless they\u0026rsquo;re the ones on the product when you buy it because zeroing a scale is annoying. However, you needed education and a warning. There are both volumetric and massive units called ounces. The measurement gods have done this to confuse you for their own amusement. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall into their trap. These are not the interchangeable. A volume ounce of almonds and a volume ounce of powdered sugar have the same volume but very different masses. So unless you\u0026rsquo;re like a TI-84, be very wary of mass to volume measurements for anything more than menial importance.\n"

	"content": "The meatball pasta situation I dream of may be a Platonic Form. Unclear. Pasta: yum. Meatballs: yum. Sauce: (conceptually) yum. And yet, when combined, often: meh. I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten enough Standard Tomato Sauce #4 (TM) for a lifetime. But I have hopes that better exists. The intent here was to reinvent the aforementioned dish by assailing it with Spanish flavors, thus bullying it into tasting good. Kind of an albondigas smuggles Italian goods into Tenerife vibe.\nThe One That Did not Live Up to It\u0026rsquo;s Potential (Highly relatable content, meatballs) I want a sauce that could accurately be described as velvetty and a flavor profile that bonks you on the head with a wooden mallet (as opposed to the much more aggressive metal models). This is not that. But a girl can dream, yeah? Side note, these were way over sauced.\nThe sofrito sauce  1/2 cup of olive oil 5 cloves of garlic (minced) 4 onions (chopped) 1 green bell pepper (chopped) 1 red bell pepper (chopped) 1 leek (white and light green bits; chopped) 6 ounce can of tomato paste 1 teaspon of corriander 1/2 cup of roasted cashews 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika 1 teaspoon of espazote 1/8 teaspoon of powdered rosemary Pinch of ajiwan seeds   Heat Oil over medium high heat until shimmering. Combine the garlic, onions, peppers, and leek in a food processor and let it go until they\u0026rsquo;re finely chopped. This increases surface area, saves time, and further entrenches your God complex (the function of all good counter top appliances). Toss the veggies in, salt them, and cook until they release their liquid and start to soften. Reduce the temperature to medium low and continue to cook, stirring when you feel like it, until the mixture is golden and sweet. Stir in the tomato paste and spices. Puree the whole shabang.  Reference: Serious Eats\u0026rsquo; Spanish Sofrito\nThe meatballs  1 pound of ground beef 1/2 cup ricotta cheese 1 egg 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint 1 teaspoon salt Pinch of ajiwan seeds 1 teaspoon of espazote 1/8 teaspoon of powdered rosemary 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes 3/4 teaspoon of corriander 1/4 teaspoon of chipolte chili powder   Preheat the pver to 450 degrees F. Grease a 9x9 baking dish. Combine all the ingredients and knead to mix. Roll into golf ball sized meatballs and arrange in the baking dish in a way that brings joy. These meatballs are friends, they should be touching. Cook for 20 minutes. By this point they should be cooked through. Toss the sauce over them and keep cooking them for another 15 minutes or until you get tired of waiting.  Reference: Daniel Holzman, Michael Chernow, \u0026amp; Lauren Deen\u0026rsquo;s The Meatball Shop Cookbook, page 4\nPop it all over pasta. I used buccatini.

	"content": "Meals Like You Mean It This is technically Novak family cookbook the third (if you are not a Novak, or do not play one on the TV, welcome, you will only get approximately 37% of the forthcoming jokes). No, its not because I\u0026rsquo;m indecisive about formatting and file structures. Nor because I keep outgrowing all attempts to confine this behemoth. Or even because I respect no Plexiglas rule and change recipes with reckless, and often unrecorded, abandon. All of these are true, but, you see, the truth is, I got tired of much abused menagerie of unwieldy binders than currently represent the real world manifestation of this collection. I can\u0026rsquo;t navigate it, you can\u0026rsquo;t navigate it, and it\u0026rsquo;ll pinch your finger off if you so much as exist. Also, I can\u0026rsquo;t own a restaurant because I dislike standing and working hard and I can\u0026rsquo;t write real cookbooks due to my obvious aversion to finalizing things. So here we are. Next step, secure a captive audience.\nThis is a cookbook, but it is also a story. Not like those suburban mom food blogs because I\u0026rsquo;m actually interesting and I would return from the grave to prevent tater tot casserole from being served at my table. And not insofar as a story is a thing with like chapters or characters or what one might casually refer to as a plot. Sure, there\u0026rsquo;s a beginning. The middle is dubious at best. And I guess the end is where we all posthumously reconvene in our family home to drive off its occupants in a coordinated haunting effort as a family bonding activity (and stand guard against inappropriate casserole application). Okay, so I appear, despite my best intentions at the outset of this, to have presented a proof by contradiction. This is my least favorite kind of proof and I\u0026rsquo;m probably more upset than you are. So it\u0026rsquo;s not a story. I probably just wanted a chance to rail on tater tot casserole and eternally preserve my afterlife plans for when they inevitably film a horror movie in our house (other must add components include: referring to Mom by her first name, banging on the filing cabinet, the nun dolls). It\u0026rsquo;s more like a card catalog (I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen one of these in person but I believe I grasp the base concept). Maintained by a toddler. Who is really into fancy spices. You can think of it as one of those murder conspiracy boards except sub the gore and intrigue for vegetables and snark. And searchability. See I was getting somewhere.\nAnyhow, I wrote that bit, got attached, and then realized that it made no sense. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t bear to part with it. So, in actuality, I would like to begin with two essential recipes. Two recipes that, no matter how many I master, I never seem to be able to live down. Both are a product of a semi-questionable free-range-parenting-before-free-range-parenting was a thing experiment. Both are very simple and I encourage you to try them at home in your free time. Strong reactions from neighbors, guests, and intruders guaranteed.\nCoffee Cake Combine flour and pasteurized lemon juice in somewhat mathematically justifiable equal proportions to your hearts content. Stir until you\u0026rsquo;ve attained the highly prized \u0026ldquo;gloop\u0026rdquo; consistency. Microwave until hard enough to cause a mild concussion when lobbed at your favorite neighborhood bully. If there is no risk of dental damage, its under cooked!\nSalsa Take one can of tomato product, it truly doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what variety. That would be Chaos with a name tag stuck to its back that says \u0026ldquo;Hello. My Name Is Versatility\u0026rdquo;. For a fun dash of spontaneity, choose one while blindfolded. Disturb your fellow grocery shoppers! I encourage it. To this can of tomato product, simply add spices. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean this is the superior if-you-were-a-person-with-any-modicum-of-cooking-ability-you\u0026rsquo;d-know-how-to-season-this way (this time). But rather as an expression of that versatility demon of chaos I mentioned earlier. Add whatever brings you joy: ground spices, whole spices, various sundry seasoning adjacent powders (this includes geographical proximity in the pantry). No need for any discrimination between spicy and spices. Lots of spices = spicy. This is why I\u0026rsquo;m a math major.\nNo one had the good sense to put a stop to all this then so now here we are. With your expectations are appropriately lowered, let\u0026rsquo;s begin. Welcome to my little shop (where nothing is sold because freedom of information is important) of horrors (no whores here, Maggie would never abide it).\n"
