This is a Hungarian beef stew primarily seasoned with paprika. It's meant to be in the sweet spot between "Why is this water red?" and "The snot adds to the experience". I have not yet struck this balance. Going for a roasty/herby/earthy background too. That'd be nice.

## The One I May Have Stockholm Syndrome For
This is a stew I made when, instead of falling for my trick and staying in New York, winter followed me to Texas so I could meet it in a vastly less prepared locale. It was eleven degrees, this was warm. You may infer how I became attached to it. In reality, I have blocked that whole situation from my memory and have no idea what it tastes like.

* 2 tablespoons of white sesame seeds
* 1 1/2 tablespoons of half sharp paprika
* 1 1/2 tablespoons of sweet paprika
* 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon of caraway seeds
* 1 teaspoon of white pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon of dill seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon of nigella seeds
