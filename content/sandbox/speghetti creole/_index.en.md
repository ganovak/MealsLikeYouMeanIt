The meatball pasta situation I dream of may be a Platonic Form. Unclear. Pasta: yum. Meatballs: yum. Sauce: (conceptually) yum. And yet, when combined, often: meh. I've eaten enough Standard Tomato Sauce #4 (TM) for a lifetime. But I have hopes that better exists. The intent here was to reinvent the aforementioned dish by assailing it with Spanish flavors, thus bullying it into tasting good. Kind of an albondigas smuggles Italian goods into Tenerife vibe. 

## The One That Did not Live Up to It's Potential (Highly relatable content, meatballs)
I want a sauce that could accurately be described as velvetty and a flavor profile that bonks you on the head with a wooden mallet (as opposed to the much more aggressive metal models). This is not that. But a girl can dream, yeah? Side note, these were way over sauced.

### The sofrito sauce

* 1/2 cup of olive oil
* 5 cloves of garlic (minced)
* 4 onions (chopped)
* 1 green bell pepper (chopped)
* 1 red bell pepper (chopped)
* 1 leek (white and light green bits; chopped)
* 6 ounce can of tomato paste
* 1 teaspon of corriander
* 1/2 cup of roasted cashews
* 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon of espazote
* 1/8 teaspoon of powdered rosemary
* Pinch of ajiwan seeds

1. Heat Oil over medium high heat until shimmering. Combine the garlic, onions, peppers, and leek in a food processor and let it go until they're finely chopped. This increases surface area, saves time, and further entrenches your God complex (the function of all good counter top appliances). Toss the veggies in, salt them, and cook until they release their liquid and start to soften.
2. Reduce the temperature to medium low and continue to cook, stirring when you feel like it, until the mixture is golden and sweet.
3. Stir in the tomato paste and spices. Puree the whole shabang.

### The meatballs

* 1 pound of ground beef
* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
* 1 teaspoon salt
* Pinch of ajiwan seeds
* 1 teaspoon of espazote
* 1/8 teaspoon of powdered rosemary
* 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
* 3/4 teaspoon of corriander
* 1/4 teaspoon of chipolte chili powder

1. Preheat the pver to 450 degrees F. Grease a 9x9 baking dish.
2. Combine all the ingredients and knead to mix. Roll into golf ball sized meatballs and arrange in the baking dish in a way that brings joy. These meatballs are friends, they should be touching.
3. Cook for 20 minutes. By this point they should be cooked through. Toss the sauce over them and keep cooking them for another 15 minutes or until you get tired of waiting.

Pop it all over pasta. I used buccatini. Previously unaware of its LifeSaver-like capabilities.
