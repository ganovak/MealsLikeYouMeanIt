## Beef I have with the cookbook industry

* **Taking advantage of people who don't know better**: making cooking seem too hard, too easy, too time consuming, taking no time at all, too expensive, way cheap, super healthy, super unhealthy, etc.
* **Diet culture**:yucky "healthy" food, making people feel bad about themselves and their choices, valuable personalities, resources, and real estate on the shelf going towards promoting objectively harmful attitudes and behaviors.
* **Fancy chef syndrome**: selective amnesia of how actual human people consume their food.
* **Holier-than-thou-edness**: as relates to dietary restrictions, lifestyle, cultural authenticity, expense of ingredients and/or tools, time/effort availible for cooking
* **Cookbooks without pictures**
