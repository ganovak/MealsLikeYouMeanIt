Once upon a time, I was waiting patiently for Mary to swipe me into Danfo when I was brutally attacked by one who I had thought an ally. Ella asked me how cold it was outside (everyone's go to conversational topic in Rochester, NY from October through May). I responded 30 degrees. She looked me dead in the eye and asked me what that was in "real degrees". That is to say that yes, the metric system has slightly more order to its arbitration, but I am an American, therefore it is my patriotic duty to be a stubborn git and make people from other countries look smarter in comparison. Moral of the story, I don't get the metric system. Honestly, you should be grateful I'm providing measurements at all.

## Volume

Entries in each row are equivilent. The "~" symbol (scientific name: *squigly doo*) means approximately (or ish for our more precision minded friends out there).

Teaspoon | Tablespoon | 1/8 cup | 1/4 cup | 1/3 cup | 1/2 cup | Cup |
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
**1** | 1/3 | 1/6 | 1/12 | x | 1/24 | 1/48 |
3 | **1** | 1/2 | 1/4 | x | 1/8 | 1/16 |
6 | 2 | **1** | 1/2 | x | 1/4 | 1/8 |
12 | 4 | 2 | **1** | x | 1/2 | 1/4 |
~16 | ~5 1/3 | x | x | **1** | x | 1/3 |
24 | 8 | 4 | 2 | x | **1** | 1/2 |
48 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 3 | 2 | **1** |

Note that dry and wet cup measurements are identical. Don't be a fool. It's about tool specialization.

Fluid ounce | Cup | Pint | Quart | Gallon |
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
**1** | 1/8 | 1/16 | 1/32 | 1/128 |
8 | **1** | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/16 |
16 | 2 | **1** | 1/2 | 1/8 |
32 | 4 | 2 | **1** | 1/4 |
128 | 16 | 8 | 4 | **1** |

## Mass

(Yes, these are conversions for mass, not weight. Technically mass is a measure of the matter in an object, measured in kilograms or because America is stubborn, pounds, ounces, etc. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object, measured in Newtons, which is an entirely useless measure for cooking. You may be asking yourself, but all objects on Earth are acted on by the same force of gravity so why does it matter. At which point I would inform you that gravitation has to do with the distance between the center of the object and the center of the gravitating body which is why your weight (but not mass) changes slightly at high altitudes. Additionally, while all objects near the surface of the Earth have the same acceleration due to gravity, the actual force exerted on them by gravity is dependent on their mass. There's also other things that matter like air resistance. So no, objects are not acted on by an equal force of gravity and yes, scales display mass because the math is simple and the mortals don't understand physics. You may now consider yourself educated.)

That said, I don't really use massive measurements unless they're the ones on the product when you buy it because zeroing a scale is annoying. However, you needed education and a warning. There are both volumetric and massive units called ounces. The measurement gods have done this to confuse you for their own amusement. Don't fall into their trap. These are not the interchangeable. A volume ounce of almonds and a volume ounce of powdered sugar have the same volume but very different masses. So unless you're like a TI-84, be very wary of mass to volume measurements for anything more than menial importance.
