# Multiplication and Division

Technically I could make this short and sweet, tell you that half of 1/3 cup is about 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons, and allow us all to move on with our lives. That really is most of what you need to know. However, the rest of what you need to know requires fluency in multiplication and division, both of which continue to elude me despite my ongoing campaign to trick the UR math department into handing me a degree. I don't think I'm supposed to tell you this, but if a recipe calls for a fractional bit of something I don't want to split (like an egg), I usually round up. Call it measurement variation.

Generally, if you start ending up with unweildy measurements, its because you, yourself, are being unweildy and should reconsider.

Multiplier | 1/8 teaspoon | 1/4 teaspoon | 1/2 teaspoon | 3/4 teaspoon | Teaspoon | Tablespoon

**1 1/2** | 1/8 teaspoon + pinch | 3/8 teaspoon | 3/4 teaspoon | 1 1/8 teaspoons | 1 1/2 teaspoon | 1 tablespoon + 1 1/2 teaspoon (or 4 1/2 teaspoons)
**2** | 1/4 teaspoon | 1/2 teaspoon | teaspoon | 1 1/2 teaspoons | 2 teaspoons | 2 tablespoons
